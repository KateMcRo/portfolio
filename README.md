# Kate Rogers | Portfolio

## Description

Potential employers will want to see examples of my coding work. 

- This advanced CSS portfolio project was an oportunity to expand my skills.
- The finished product demonstrates what I learned and offers a place to display other projects.
- I learned the importance of organization from the onset. I experimented with wire framing and CUBE organization in an effort to clean up my code.
